# SHARE GRAVITY

This is a task for the interviewing process of Blue Gravity.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project was built with Node.js version 20.11.0, use a similar or newer version to avoid conflicts.

To install run:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, you should have all the required dependencies installed.

It's time to run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After some processing your terminal will indicate the local _http://localhost:3000_, open your browser on it and see for yourself. Hope you like it.

#### Important to know:

It may take some time build the pages fully when running "npm run dev", because the server is compiling the code as you try to acess a new page. Pay attention to your terminal, that will display a "Compiling / ..." prompt, when ready it will change to "Compiled".
